### Trajectory settings
  # number of time nodes to evaluate constraints
N: 14

  # distribution of the time nodes
time_discretization: Chebyshev # Chebyshev, Uniform

  # degree of the Bezier curve (as the desired trajectory)
degree: 5

### Gait behavior settings
  # torso rotation angle toelration (rad)
eps_torso_angle: 0.02

  # step height (m) (in the middle of the gait)
swingfoot_midstep_z_des: 0.10

  # position with respect to the forward direction of the robot at the beginning
swingfoot_begin_y_des: 0.00

  # position with respect to the forward direction of the robot at the end
swingfoot_end_y_des: -0.00  

  # examples:
  # 1. swingfoot_begin_y_des/swingfoot_end_y_des being positive 
  #    means the swing foot is in front of the robot.
  # 2. swingfoot_begin_y_des/swingfoot_end_y_des being negative 
  #    means the swing foot is behind the robot.
  # 3. swingfoot_begin_y_des being negative, and swingfoot_end_y_des being positive 
  #    means the robot is walking forward.
  # 4. swingfoot_begin_y_des being positive, and swingfoot_end_y_des being negative
  #    means the robot is walking backward.
  # 5. For periodic gaits, the absolute values of swingfoot_begin_y_des and swingfoot_end_y_des should be the same,
  #    since the gait should be symmetric.
  #    Otherwise, you need to turn off or change the periodicity reset map constraint.

### Ipopt Optimization settings
  # terminal condition 1: optimality tolerance
tol: 1e-5

  # terminal condition 2: constraint violation tolerance
constr_viol_tol: 1e-4

  # terminal condition 3: maximum wall time
max_wall_time: 100.0

  # terminal condition 4: maximum number of iterations
max_iter: 200

  # scale the objective function
obj_scaling_factor: 1e-3

  # print level
print_level: 5 # 0: no output, 5: detailed output that is usually enough for tuning parameters

  # mu_strategy
mu_strategy: adaptive # "adaptive" for more aggressive attempts, "monotone" for more conservative convergence

  # linear solver (HSL)
linear_solver: ma57 # ma27, ma57, ma86, ma97, pardiso

  # turn on gradient check or not
gredient_check: false # true, false
